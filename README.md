## Description


Sentimentext is a browser extension that automatically warns users about those news articles that linguistically resemble the style of a fake news. Sentimentext scans the content of a webpage and analyses how emotionally loaded such content is by looking at its narrative style, the pattern of adjectives and syntaxes used. Sentimentext does not tell whether a news is fake or not: we do not want to tell people what to think, but give them a tool that helps them to think.

Fake news are found to purposefully employ emotional jargon and emotional narratives to hamper logical-thinking and foster emotional responses istead. They want to make you feel something. The emotional load of a text is usually analysed with a machine learning technique called sentiment analysis, which scores text based on two values: polarity and subjectivity. Several studies show how fake news are likely to have negative polarity [Kapusta et al. 2020] and high subjectivity [Volkova et al. 2017]. We want to use this distinctive emotional content of fake news to fight misinformation and provide citizens with a simple tool which alerts them of such possible suspicious behaviour.
